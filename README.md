# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📋 Project Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The aim is to uncover hidden patterns, relationships between variables, and insights related to passenger survival.

The EDA covers statistical exploration and visual exploration using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

---

## 📚 Datasets Used
- **train.csv** - Training data including features and survival labels.
- **test.csv** - Testing data without survival labels.
- **gender_submission.csv** - Example submission file showing gender-based survival.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 EDA Steps Followed
1. **Dataset Overview**
   - `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`
2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Checking missing values
3. **Visualizations**
   - `sns.pairplot()` to see relationships
   - `sns.heatmap()` for correlation
   - Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots
   - Countplots for categorical distributions
4. **Observations**
   - Key findings documented after each plot.
5. **Summary of Findings**
   - Written summary consolidating all insights.

## 📊 Key Findings
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males.
- 1st Class passengers had better survival rates compared to other classes.
- Higher fares were linked to increased chances of survival.
- Younger passengers (especially children) had a higher chance of survival.
- Majority of passengers embarked from Southampton.
